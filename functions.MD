# Functions

If you think about it, every action in your life can be broken down just a few things:

1. a procedure or formula for doing something
2. the inputs required for this procedure to work
3. the output (result) of the procedure

**Exercise - think about the formula for calculating something - pick one of the ideas and write it into code**

1. Think of the formula.

```
var area = length * width;
```

We've already got the main body of the function.

2. Let's wrap this inside javascript function syntax;

```javascript
function() {
	var area = length * width;
}
```

3. We put the inputs inside of the **( )** after the function keyword.

```javascript
function(length, width) {	
	var area = length * width;
}
```

4. The purpose of making functions is to re-use them. So it needs a name for us to refer to it again in the future.

```javascript
var calcRectangleArea = function(length, width) {
	var area = length * width;
}
```

5. The function needs to return an output, so we add a `return` to the end:

```javascript
var calcRectangleArea = function(length, width) {
	var area = length * width;
	return area;
}
```

**Exercise - create at least 5 of your own functions**
