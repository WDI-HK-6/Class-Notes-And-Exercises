#Array Exercises

##Make 3 different arrays with only numbers.
##Make 3 arrays with text instead of numbers.
```javascript
var animals = ['bird', 'lion', 'cat', 'dog', 'blue', 'horse']; 
// is there anything wrong with this array?
// get 'dog'

var cars = ['Honda', 'Ford', 'Toyota', 1, 'BMW']; 
// is there anything wrong with this array?
// get 1

var names = ['Fred', 'Sally', 'Simon', 'Tom', 'Joe']; 
// is there anything wrong with this array?
// get 'Tom' and 'Joe'
```
##Create an array for holidays.
##Create an array for something else.
```javascript
var simon = {
	eyes = 2;
	name = Simon;
	legs = 2;
};
// is there something wrong with this hash? If there is, fix it.
```

```javascript
var car = {
	brand: 'Honda'
	license plate: 'HY32HT'
	num wheels: 4
};
// is there something wrong with this hash? If there is, fix it.
```
With the fixed ```car``` hash:

	- get the brand

	- get the brand in another way

	- get the license plate

	- can the license plate be retrieved in another way?

	- get the number of wheels

	- can the number of wheels be retrieved in another way?

##Make 3 hashes.
