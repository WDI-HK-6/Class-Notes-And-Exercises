#AJAX and HighCharts Exercise

##Project

Make a page like this: http://ga-student-page.meteor.com/playground/highcharts-annotation

- Make sure the graph is grabbing data from an API.

- Make sure it can POST new annotations to the server.

- Make sure those new annotations pop up on the chart (GET).

- Make sure you can view all of your annotations in a list (GET). Check out Bootstrap Modals and Sidebars.

- Make sure you can update and delete all of your existing annotations in the list (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using buttons, forms, and AJAX.
