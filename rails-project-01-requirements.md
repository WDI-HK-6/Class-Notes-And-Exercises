# Rails Project #1 Requirements

For your first Rails project, you ***must*** have and use the following:

Required:

- User Accounts
- At least three relationships between three different objects (users, something, something else)
- Full CRUD on at least one object's data set.
- Responsive Front End with Bootstrap Grid
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Deployed to Heroku

Optional:

- AJAX
- ActionMailer

Some ideas: 

- An online javascript game that stores a user's high score and has a leaderboard for displaying the users with top scores
- An e-commerce store with items that a user can "buy" and look at their past orders or delete orders.
